---

**Phase B & C Complete** (21:55 UTC)

**RainXRP Post-Mortem Results**:
- H3qSndFC: CONFIRMED 3-token insider (bought RXRP in 8 seconds, $297)
- Hqf4TZxp: Downgraded (did NOT buy RXRP in first 5 min)
- New insiders found: FSbvLdrK1FuW (XRPEP3+RXRP), 2NuAgVk3hcb7 (TrollXRP+RXRP)
- User wallets confirmed and excluded (321Ct, Dc5s, 9iUb, D8ZB - all bought in 1 second!)

**Phase C Pre-Launch Check**:
- NO fresh deployer funding detected since Nov 30
- This is expected - funding happens 2-3 hours before launch
- All key wallets have low balances (<0.5 SOL)
- Next check: Jan 8, 2026 (daily monitoring begins)

**Status**: Investigation paused until closer to launch date.

### January 8, 2026

**Daily Monitoring Resumes**

**Wallet Status Check**:
| Wallet | Jan 3 | Jan 8 | Change |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 37Xxihfs | 0.0714 | 0.0714 | No change |
| v49j | 0.3087 | 0.0272 | -0.28 SOL |
| GUCX6xNe | 0.0151 | 0.0151 | No change |
| Bz2yexdH | 0.0209 | 0.0209 | No change |

**v49j Balance Drop Investigation**:
Checked v49j counterparties (Dec-Jan). The 0.28 SOL drop was:
- Trading activity (BloomBot)
- Small transfers: $849 to Bra1HUNK, $84 to 37Xxihfs
- NOT deployer funding (would need 8-15 SOL)

**Status**: No deployer wallet has been funded. All wallets < 0.1 SOL.

**Playbook Pre-Investigation Status**:
- [x] H3qSndFC investigation (Threat #6) - COMPLETE
- [x] Sleeper wallet inventory (Threat #3) - COMPLETE
- [x] RXRP cross-token analysis (Threat #8) - Done (Jan 3)

**H3qSndFC Investigation Result**:
- Connection Score: 0/100
- Verdict: **INDEPENDENT** - Not connected to deployer chain
- Funding Origin: Crypto.com → Binance (NOT Coinbase)
- Action: Monitor competitively only, not a leading indicator

**2-Token Insider Investigation** (Jan 8):
| Insider | Tokens | Funding Origin | Balance | Verdict |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|---------|
| **FSbvLdrK** | XRPEP3 + RXRP | → Coinbase Hot Wallet | 0.05 SOL | **CONNECTED** |
| 2NuAgVk3 | TrollXRP + RXRP | → PYTH / Trading bots | 871 SOL | Independent (whale) |

**FSbvLdrK is CONNECTED to deployer chain!**
- Funding trace: FSbvLdrK → DfwNaPDh → 91CuNTxy (BloomBot) → **GJRs4FwH (Coinbase Hot Wallet)**
- Same Coinbase origin as our deployer chain
- Could be used as secondary leading indicator

**Sleeper Wallet Inventory Result**:
All chain-funded wallets verified:
| Deployer | First Funder | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| D7Ms | v49j | Known deployer |
| DBmx | v49j | Known deployer |
| Bz2y | 37Xxihfs | Known deployer |
| GUCX | v49j | **Sleeper (0.015 SOL)** |

No NEW unknown sleeper wallets found. GUCX remains the only unused chain-funded wallet.

**Scripts Created**:
- `src/investigate-h3qsndfc.ts` - Insider chain investigation
- `src/sleeper-inventory.ts` - Chain-funded wallet discovery
- `src/quick-query.ts` - Ad-hoc query utility

**Next**: Daily monitoring (`npm run status`) until launch.

- This is approaching the deployer funding threshold (8-15 SOL)
- **PRE-LAUNCH SIGNAL**: v49j is accumulating funds for Jan 18

### January 16, 2026 (Evening Session)

**T-2 DAYS FULL CHECK + USDC INVESTIGATION**

**Wallet Status (Jan 16 Evening - 20:52 UTC)**:
| Wallet | Balance | USDC/USDT | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| v49j | 7.1791 SOL | 2.58 USDC | 🚨 Approaching threshold |
| 37Xxihfs | 0.0714 SOL | - | Dormant |
| GUCX6xNe | 0.0151 SOL | - | Dormant sleeper |
| Bz2yexdH | 0.0209 SOL | - | Dormant |
| FSbvLdrK | 0.0511 SOL | - | Dormant |
| H3qSndFC | 0.3496 SOL | - | Dormant |

**USDC Movement Investigation**:
User flagged v49j USDC transfers - investigated both recipients:

| Recipient | Amount | First Funder | Chain Connection |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| E41iCF | 199.2 USDC | 5bNCz3Z7 | ❌ NOT in deployer chain |
| HRcur4 | 200 USDC total | GOATGUY Token Deployer | ❌ Different deployer network |

HRcur4 chain: HRcur4 → GOATGUY → BOOMAS → Magic Eden (separate entity)

**Scripts Updated for Stablecoin Monitoring**:
- `quick-status.ts` - Now shows USDC/USDT balances
- `full-prelaunch-check.ts` - Now tracks all token transfers

**New Scripts Created**:
- `investigate-v49j-today.ts`
- `full-prelaunch-check.ts`
- `check-fresh-candidate.ts`
- `investigate-usdc-recipients.ts`
- `trace-hrcur4-chain.ts`
- `check-hrcur4.ts`

**Conclusion**: USDC transfers are operational trading, NOT deployer prep. Deployer still NOT funded.

- Funding chain traces to Coinbase Hot Wallet (GJRs4FwH)
- Has DIRECT counterparty relationship with 37Xxihfs ($273 OUT)
- Also traded with DBmxMiP8 (known deployer)
- Full chain: Coinbase → 91CuNTxy → DfwNaPDh → FSbvLdrK

- Balance: 309.81 SOL ($44K)
- 30 transactions in January
- Active at time of investigation (05:46 UTC Jan 16)
- Net flow: +32 SOL (ACCUMULATING)

**Key Finding #4: Profit Extraction Wallet Active Jan 9**
- 4yWaU1Qr (Bz2yexdH's child wallet) was active 7 days ago

- Confirms entity is active and moving money

**Key Finding #5: Hqf4TZxp Downgrade CONFIRMED**
- Did NOT buy RXRP at all (checked DEX trades + wallet transactions)
- Remove from watchlist

**Key Finding #6: Trading Bots Are Entity Infrastructure**
- HVRcXaCF: Funded v49j ($1,783) + Sent to profit wallet Jan 9
- Ed4UGBWK: Funded Bz2yexdH ($63K) + Received $205K from profit wallet
- These bots circulate money within the entity's network

**Key Finding #7: ROOT Confirmed Dormant**
- 0.0035 SOL balance
- No activity since June 2025
- Remove from watchlist

**Scripts Created**:
- `src/trace-unexplored.ts` - Trace unexplored wallet leads
- `src/deep-investigation.ts` - Fill all blind spots
- `src/check-hqf4-rxrp.ts` - Verify Hqf4TZxp RXRP purchase
- `src/explain-profit-extraction.ts` - Trace profit extraction flow

**Updated Telegram Bot Watchlist (7 wallets)**:

Tier 1 (Critical):
- v49j - 7.18 SOL, watch for outbound >5 SOL
- 37Xxihfs - Watch for outbound >5 SOL
- GUCX6xNe - Watch for ANY activity

Tier 2 (High):
- FSbvLdrK - UPGRADED: Direct connection to 37Xxihfs + DBmx
- Bz2yexdH - Could be reused
- 4yWaU1Qr - Profit extraction, was active Jan 9

Tier 3 (Intel):
- H3qSndFC - 3-token insider (8 sec buy speed)

Removed:
- ~~Hqf4TZxp~~ - Confirmed did not buy RXRP
- ~~ROOT~~ - Confirmed dormant
- ~~HVRcXaCF~~ - Trading bot, not predictive
- ~~Ed4UGBWK~~ - Trading bot, not predictive
- ~~2NuAgVk3~~ - Just a whale, 120s buy speed is not insider-fast, too noisy

**Confidence Level**: 90% we will detect deployer through v49j outbound or FSbvLdrK funding

*2NuAgVk3 removed (Jan 16) - 120s buy speed is not insider-fast, just an active whale*

---

## January 2026 Prediction

### Current Status (Jan 3, 2026)

**No fresh deployer wallet has been funded yet.** This is expected - funding typically happens 2-3 hours before launch.

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 37Xxihfs outbound (since Nov 30) | No significant transfers |
| v49j outbound (since Nov 30) | No significant transfers |
| Fresh wallet candidates | None detected |
| Insider activity | H3qSndFC last seen Nov 30 |

### Possible Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Signal to Watch |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| New fresh wallet funded | 60% | v49j or 37Xxihfs sends 8-15 SOL |
| Reuse Bz2yexdH (RXRP) | 25% | Bz2yexdH receives new funding |
| Reuse GUCX6xNe (pre-funded) | 10% | Any activity on GUCX6xNe |
| New pattern | 5% | Unknown |

### Confidence Assessment
- **Current Confidence**: 30% (waiting for funding signal)
- **Target Confidence**: 90%+
- **Confidence will increase when**: Fresh wallet receives 8-15 SOL from chain

### Timing Prediction
- **Announcement**: Jan 10, 2026
- **Expected Launch**: Jan 12 (Sunday) or Jan 19 (Sunday)
- **Launch Window**: 10 AM - 12 PM Pacific
- **Funding Signal**: 2-3 hours before launch

### Action Items
1. Run `npm run status` daily starting Jan 8
2. Watch for v49j/37Xxihfs outbound SOL > 5
3. When funding detected, verify First Funder = deployer chain
